## Files

### `src/main/java/com/myapp/App.java`

This file contains the main class `App` which serves as the entry point of the application. It can be used to initialize and run the Maven Java project.

### `src/main/resources`

This directory is used to store any resources (such as configuration files, properties files, etc.) that are required by the application.

### `src/test/java/com/myapp/AppTest.java`

This file contains the test class `AppTest` which can be used to write unit tests for the `App` class or any other classes in the project.

### `src/test/resources`

This directory is used to store any test-specific resources that are required for running the tests.

### `pom.xml`

This file is the Project Object Model (POM) file for the Maven project. It contains the project configuration, dependencies, build settings, and other project-related information.

## Usage

To use this project as a template for your own Java application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Modify the `App.java` file in the `src/main/java/com/myapp` directory to implement your application logic.
3. Add any required resources to the `src/main/resources` directory.
4. Write unit tests for your application in the `AppTest.java` file in the `src/test/java/com/myapp` directory.
5. Run the tests using your preferred testing framework.
6. Build and package your application using Maven.
7. Deploy and run your application.
